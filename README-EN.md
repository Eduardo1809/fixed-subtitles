# Fixed Subtitles

In this project there are subtitles from fansub groups and streaming websites with expired licenses.

Usually it's better that the subtitles authors to fix their own errors, but it isn't always possible: sometimes they don't have enough time or can't be contacted. It's also possible that the licenses of streaming websites expire before fixes were applied.

No video file is available here. We recommend that you get those videos via legal means such as disk importing. We also recommend that streaming services renew their contracts and get the fixed subtitles found here.

If you find an error in some translation, and even in this file, send a pull request fixing it. Check [CONTRIBUTING-EN.md](https://github.com/qgustavor/fixed-subtitles/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING-EN.md) for more information.
