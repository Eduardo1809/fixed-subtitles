    title: Why fixing subtitles?
    time: Sometimes the original translators can't fix those
    time2: Maybe they're too busy in other projects, retired from translating or even, in the case of streaming services, lost their licenses.
    opensource: Many people can contribute
    opensource2: It's easy to oversee your own errors, but if with people help contributing it's possible to avoid those issues.
