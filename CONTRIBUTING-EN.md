# Contributing

I recommend proposing changes via pull requests so your name will be stored in the contributors page, also creating a GitHub account is quite easy. Finally, please use a spell checker before submitting it. Any fix is accepted, even the smallest ones: not fixing small errors will make those accumulate.  But, if possible, try to merge small errors in a single commit to make the contribution review easier.

When submitting a new anime commit first the original file, then the fix in other commit, so it's possible to check changes.

## Folder organization:

* Create a folder for each anime and inside each one other folder for each translation group;
* Use the romanized name as the folder name, prefixed by the AniList ID prefix, separated by hyphen;
* If the name is too long (more than 25 characters), you can use some abbreviation based on the romanized name ([this anime](https://myanimelist.net/anime/14749/Ore_no_Kanojo_to_Osananajimi_ga_Shuraba_Sugiru) can be shortened to Oreshura);
* Try to use the original subtitle or video name in files;
* On file and folder names remove those characters as they don't work well in Windows systems: `\\/:*?"<>|`

## Non-anime content:

* For other content you can adapt the rules above for the media you're submitting;
* If you're not using a MyAnimeList ID include the website abbreviation like this: ["IMDB-0120338 - Titanic"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/), ["MDL-19702 - NIGEHAJI"](http://mydramalist.com/19702-nigeru-wa-haji-da-ga-yaku-ni-tatsu).
* In case the abbreviations are too confusing open an issue pointing this.
